# Assignment_3
Task1 : Calculate factorial using function.
Step 1: Take integer input from the user which will store in variable num1.
Step 2: creat a function named fact(n) where n is the agrument it receives the value from calling by user
Step 3: create an if & else expression with this formulla where (n ==0 or n ==1) if n is equals to 0 or 1 it would enter inside if statement otherwise jumps to else part
Step 4: so here the formulla does'nt match this given number n 
Step 5: in the else part return value which is return n * fact(n -1) [ 5 * ( 5 - 1_)]
Step 6: value of n will decrese with the help of ( 5-1), ( 4-1), ( 3-1), ( 2-1), ( 1-1) finally the value will be match with n == 0  then return 1
Step 7: a is the variable and it print the collected value.

Output is here given below :
Enter the number : 5
Factorial of 5  is :  120

Task2 : import the maths module
Step 1: Take integer input from the user which will store in variable num1.
Step 2: sqrt = math.sqrt(num1) here sqrt is predefined method, which helps in calculate the value of num1 in square
Step 3: print root square
Step 4: result = math.log(num1), here result is variable which store the value of log
Step 5: sin_value = math.sin(num1), here sin_value is variable which store the value of sine
Step 6: print all value here given below

Output :
Enter the Number : 25
Square root:  5.0
Natural logarithm : 3.2188758248682006
Sine :  -0.13235175009777303
